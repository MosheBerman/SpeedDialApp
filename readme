SpeedDialApp is a commented, open source version of the Hatzalah and Shomrim apps on the App Store.

This code is released for academic purposes only. Use it at your own risk.

A quick note about the numbers:

The app stores numbers in a plist file which must be renamed after each change to ensure that the app uses the new list. A corresponding constant is in "Constants.h" which is used to identify the appropriate file.

AN IMPORTANT NOTE about Code Signing:

Before you try to run this app on a device, make sure that you properly set up code signing and the app bundle ID as necessary.
